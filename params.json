{"name":"Pycamanager","tagline":"UI for managing CA  certificate authority PKI GUI","body":"# Python CA Manager\r\n\r\nThis simple, ready to use tool, helps you manage your own CA. It`s based on curses library and use python3.\r\n\"caman.py\" leads you through init procedure if you run it for a first time. Then caman.py will serve as a CA manager.\r\n\r\n## Try it without installation with VirtualBox instance!!!\r\n[Downaload](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i7bih3clyl48cp6/pyCAmanager.tar.bz2?dl=0)\r\n\r\n## DEPENDENCIES:\r\n1. openssl\r\n1. python3\r\n\r\n## INSTALATION:\r\n* apt-get install openssl\r\n* caman.py create \r\n* caman.py init \r\n* edit openssl.cnf.\r\n```\r\n[ CA_default ]\r\ndir=/path/where_certs_will_be_stored\r\nnew_certs_dir= $dir/signed_certs\r\n```\r\n* edit subj.info \r\n* run caman.py\r\n\r\n## ABOUT\r\n\r\nI use \"caman.py\" for radius and EAP. \"caman.py\" perform only manager actions but there is hook functionality. Here are three of them:\r\n1) \"new.hook\" is called after cert singing. It accepts three arguments CN(commcon name), email and days\r\n2) \"revoke.hook\" is called after cert revoking. It accepts three arguments cert file name, CN and email\r\n3) \"crl.hook\" is called after generating CRL. No arguments are avaliable for this hook\r\nYou can use \"crl.hook\", for example, to transfer CRL to radius server.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash  \r\nSCP=`which scp`  \r\nSSH=`which ssh`  \r\n! /bin/cat $PKI_ROOT/cacert.pem $PKI_ROOT/crl.pem > $PKI_ROOT/cacrlcert.pem && exit 1  \r\nif [[ -e $PKI_ROOT/cacrlcert.pem ]]; then  \r\n       $SCP $PKI_ROOT/cacrlcert.pem radius_admin@172.16.0.1:/home/putcert #transfering crl to radius  \r\n       $SSH radadm@freeradius /home/radius_admin/radrestart.sh #restart radius  \r\nfi\r\n``` \r\n\r\nPay attention to $PKI_ROOT environment variable. It must be set to folder where CA files is located, where you are going to store\r\nall neccessary files in particular self-signed cert, index.txt etc.\r\n\r\n\"subj.info\" file.\r\n\r\nAll actions with certs require entering passwords and other information.\r\n\"subj.info\" contains information neccessary for creating cert request. \"caman.py init\" will create template: /OU=smth/O=Example Corp/C=SM/ST=Anything/L=My_place\r\n```\r\nCN: CommonName (mandatory)\r\nOU: OrganizationalUnit (can be empty. you can delete it from \"subj.info\" if you want)\r\nO: Organization (mandatory)\r\nL: Locality (mandatory)\r\nS: StateOrProvinceName (mandatory)\r\nC: CountryName (mandatory)\r\n```\r\nKeep in mind if you have problem with caman.py\r\n1. PKI_ROOT must be equal to [ CA_default ] dir= in openssl.conf. Try to keep them equal when you edit any of this pathes\r\n1. A first line of hook file must be the path to the relevant shell (for example #!/bin/bash)\r\n1. After initialization put openssl.conf file in PKI_ROOT folder","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
